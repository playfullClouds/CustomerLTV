This project dives into six core business objectives using advanced SQL queries, structured business logic, and visual storytelling via Power BI.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This analysis investigates the nuanced relationship between product returns and customer value. Instead of assuming returns are always detrimental, the project breaks down patterns across segments, product categories, demographics, and payment methods. The findings inform smarter customer retention and product strategy decisions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

1. **How do returns affect total Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)?**
2. **Which product categories have the highest return rates and how do they impact revenue and LTV?**
3. **Are specific customer demographics (age, gender) associated with higher return rates and lower LTV?**
4. **Is there a correlation between return frequency and customer churn?**
5. **Do payment methods affect the likelihood of returns and their influence on LTV?**
6. **How can we use return data to develop customer retention strategies?**
